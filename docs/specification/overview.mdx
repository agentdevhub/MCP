The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to help AI applications connect to external data sources, tools, and capabilities. This documentation contains the official specification.

## Protocol Overview

MCP enables standardized communication between:
- **Hosts**: Applications that use language models
- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application
- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities

The protocol is built on [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 and focuses on:
- Sharing contextual information with language models
- Exposing tools and capabilities to AI systems
- Building composable integrations and workflows

## Available Revisions

MCP follows a versioning approach based on dates (YYYY-MM-DD). Revisions may be marked as:

- **Draft**: In-progress specifications, not yet ready for production use
- **Current**: The stable protocol version, which may continue to receive backward-compatible changes
- **Final**: Past, complete specifications that will not be changed
